# Plugins

## C4D IDE

Also a very old plugin that is not very progressed and also currently provides
two different approaches to implementing a Python IDE in Cinema 4D.

## PyObject

An alternative to the Cinema 4D standard Python Generator object that allows
you to implement a number of other `ObjectData` methods.

## PyShader

This simple Cinema 4D plugin allows you to write shaders on-the-fly or
prototype for a native shader plugin.

## Unicode Escape Tool

String resources require special characters to be escaped with unicode
escape sequences in the format of `\UXXXX`. The "Unicode Escape Tool"
can handle this for you. Just enter or paste the stringtable or text
and you can convert it.

!!! note "Resource Packages"
    You don't need this tool if you make use of [ResourcePackages](../cli#c4ddev-rpkg).
    Non-ascii characters will be escaped automatically when a stringtable
    is generated from the ResourcePackage.

## Scripting Server
