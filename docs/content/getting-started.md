# Getting Started

C4DDev can be installed in two ways: Into your Cinema 4D plugins directory
and as a command-line tool.

## Installing the C4DDev Plugins

  [GitHub Releases]: https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/c4ddev/releases

Head to the [GitHub Releases] page and download the latest release for your
platform (Windows or macOS). Then unpack the directory into your Cinema 4D
plugins directory.

    Cinema 4D R18/
      plugins/
        c4ddev/
          ...

## Installing the C4DDev command-line tools

You need either Python 2 or 3 installed on your system and the [Pip] package
manager. Pip comes pre-installed with Python 3 on Windows, but with Python 2
you will need to run the [get-pip.py] script first. You may need to start the
terminal with admin privileges to install Pip.

    > python get-pip.py

After this step, you can install the command-line tools by running the
following command (again, you may need admin privileges).

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/c4ddev.git

Now you should be able to use the `c4ddev` command-line program.

    $ c4ddev
