# Scripting

The **C4DDev** API provides some utilities that are especially useful for
scripting and prototyping in Cinema 4D.

## Per-Project libraries

This is extremely useful when using third party libraries in scripts or
Python Objects/Tags. You can keep the dependencies together with your
Cinema 4D scene file and only make sure that **C4DDev** is installed if
you move the scene around.

```python
# This is a version of localimport that is tuned to work from inside any
# scripting context in Cinema 4D (Tag, Object, XPresso Node).
from c4ddev.scripting.localimport import localimport

with localimport(doc):
  import twitter

def main():
  # TODO: Some clever example
  pass
```

## Script Server

Originally the **SublimeScript** plugin, this allows you to turn on a socket
listening for scripts to be executed in Cinema 4D. In the `extras/` directory
of C4DDev, you can find a plugin for Sublime Text that allows you to send a
script to Cinema 4D.

The default host and port is `localhost:2900` and the default password is
`alpine`.

!!! warn "Caution"
    Note that enabling the Script Server can make your computer vulnerable
    to **targeted attacks**. Use only for development purpose and do not use on
    production servers.
